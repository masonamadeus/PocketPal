# manifest.json - PocketPal PWA Manifest
#
# This file describes how your web app appears to the system and how it should behave when installed on a device's home screen.
#
# Field explanations:
#   name: Full name of your app as it appears to users.
#   short_name: Shorter name for use where space is limited (e.g., home screen icon).
#   start_url: The page that loads when the app is launched from the home screen.
#   display: 'standalone' makes the app look like a native app (no browser UI).
#   background_color: Used for the splash screen and task switcher background.
#   theme_color: Color of the browser's address bar and OS UI.
#   icons: Array of icon objects for different device requirements (sizes, types).
#
# Note: JSON does not support comments. This file is for your reference only.
