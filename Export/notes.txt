Standard Screen Events - Let's keep it minimal for now:

SCREEN_LOADED:

Published by: A Screen instance (from within its initialize() method, after it's set up).
Purpose: Signals to the ScreenManager (and potentially other parts of the application) that the screen has finished its initialization and is ready.
Data (Optional): Could include the screen's name or ID. For simplicity, maybe no data needed initially.


SCREEN_DISPOSED:

Published by: A Screen instance (from within its destroy() method, after it has cleaned up).
Purpose: Signals to the ScreenManager that the screen has finished its disposal and is ready to be fully removed from memory.
Data (Optional): Could include the screen's name or ID. For simplicity, maybe no data needed initially.

BEHAVIOR DISPENSER
Expects items with naming convention:
IDENTIFIER_ALIAS__KEY_VALUE_VALUE__KEY_VALUE_VALUE
e.g.
BTN_Play_Keybind_space

MENU ITEMS
Use frame labels to do things like 'selected' and 'deselected' and stuff
MENU_1_OBJECT naming convention maybe? Have to figure out how to organize/order things.
maybe each menu item calculates its own immediate neighbors on load?

// Example within the initialization function for a menu item:
this.leftNeighbor = nearestLeft;
this.rightNeighbor = nearestRight;
this.upNeighbor = nearestUp;
this.downNeighbor = nearestDown;
